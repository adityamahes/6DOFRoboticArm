# 6DOFRoboticArm
Designed, 3D-printed, and evaluated a 6-DOF robotic arm using fixtures, simulation, and forward/inverse kinematics. Built a Tesla Optimus-inspired differentially actuated wrist achieving pitch/yaw with two servos. Integrating a BCI with a three-finger robotic gripper to extend control and functionality.
